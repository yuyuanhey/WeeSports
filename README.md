We are students in NTU, and this project is created for the app contest among three universities.<br />
We want to design an app for sport teams which allows them to have friendly matches.<br />

Everyone can see which team makes an invitation without logging in. However, if the user wants to apply for one of them, he should sign up and then get more information from the team and the match.<br />
